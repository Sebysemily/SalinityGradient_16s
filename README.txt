# How does salt influence microbial comuunities?
Questions: 
1. How is microbial biodiversity modified across a salinity gradient? 
    	-Null hypothesis: Microbial biodiversity (eg richness) does not vary across a salinity gradient.
	-hypothesis: Microbial richness will increase as salt concentration lowers.
		- There is an inverse relationship between richness and salinity.
2. How does microbial composition change a cross a salinity gradient?  
	-Null hypothesis: Microbial composition does not change across a salinity gradient.
	-Hypothesis: Dominant members of the microbial community are unique in freshwater compared to salt water.
